# 🌦️ Weather Prediction Expert System

A GUI-based expert system that predicts weather conditions using **first-order logic** and **forward chaining** with [AIMA's logic module](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python).  
Users select observed conditions (sky, wind, temperature, humidity, pressure), and the system infers the weather and provides explanations.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔧 **Rule-based inference** using first-order logic  
- 🌐 **Interactive GUI** built with Tkinter  
- 🧠 **Forward chaining algorithm** to derive weather predictions  
- 📖 **Explanations** for each prediction to improve user understanding  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** (GUI)
- **PIL (Pillow)** for image handling
- **AIMA Python** (`aima.logic`) for knowledge base and inference
